There are a lot of misconceptions about how whiskey is made and what distinguishes the different types. This page will help you understand the difference between Irish whiskey and Canadian rye whisky, and why the heck only one of those spells whiskey with an 'e'.

At a basic level all whiskey is made by fermenting a mix of grain (called a mash), then filtering and aging it. The mixture of grains used and the aging process are most of what give a whiskey it's own unique flavor. Food coloring is used surprisingly often, although some types of whiskey expressly disallow it. 

Moonshine and white whiskey are essentially whiskey without the aging process. This is much faster and cheaper to produce but generally comes with a harsher taste.

Whiskey types are largely based around regions. Distilling is a craft with a lot of history and different countries have developed their own unique methods. Sometimes there are strict laws on how a whiskey is produced, other times there are guidelines that may or may not be followed.

Whether to spell it 'whiskey' or 'whisky' is a regional custom. Scotland and Canada use 'whisky' while the US and Ireland go with 'whiskey'. There is no hard and fast rule governing this and distillers are free to spell it how they like.




Scotch is produced in, you guessed it, Scotland. This is one of those types with some strict rules. In order to be labeled as Scotch the whiskey must be produced entirely in Scotland and aged for at least three years. There are different regions such as The Highlands or Islay, each with it's own unique character. Scotch has a unique flavor that many whiskey drinkers either love or hate.

Irish Whiskey is made in Ireland with restrictions that are a bit more lax than in Scotland. There are only about ten distilleries in Ireland but they include some of the largest in the world.

Many believe that bourbon must be made in Kentucky. This is not a requirement although it must be made in the United States and 95% of bourbon is in fact made in the state of Kentucky. The mash must be made from at least 51% corn. The taste is generally smoother and sweeter than some other types of whiskey. This is a good place to start for newer whiskey drinkers. Straight bourbon must be aged for at least two years and can not contain food coloring.

Tennessee whiskey is just like straight bourbon except that it's made in Tennessee and undergoes and extra filtration process known as the Lincoln County Process.

Rye whiskeys are common in both the US and Canada but use a very different process in each place. In the US ryes are legally required to be made from at least 51% rye grain. Straight ryes, just like straight bourbon, must be aged for at least two years and can not have any food coloring added. However, Canada only requires that rye whiskey contain rye, the amount does not matter. It's perfectly fine for a Canadian rye whiskey to be made with almost no rye. Rye whiskies are known for being spicier and more peppery than some other styles. This type was extremely common in the early days of the United States but was largely replaced by the smoother complexion of bourbon after prohibition. It has recently been seeing a resurgence in the US, particularly through the growth of micro distilleries.
