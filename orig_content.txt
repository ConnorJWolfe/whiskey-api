There are a lot of misconceptions about how whiskey is made and what distinguishes the different types. This page will help you understand the difference between Irish Whiskey and Canadian Rye Whisky, and why the heck only one of those spells whiskey with an 'e'.

At a basic level all whiskey is made by fermenting a grain mash. The balance of grains used and the aging process after are most of what gives a whiskey it's own unique flavor. Food coloring is used surprisingly often, although some types of whiskey expressly disallow it.

Whiskey types are largely based around regions. Distilling is a craft with a lot of history and different countries have developed their own unique methods. Sometimes there are strict laws on how a whiskey is produced, other times there are guidelines that may or may not be followed.

Scotch is produced in, you guessed it, Scotland. This is one of those types with some strict rules. In order to be labeled as Scotch the whiskey must be produced entirely in Scotland and aged for at least three years. There are different regions such as The Highlands or Islay, each with it's own unique character.
